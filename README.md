# **🌀 ZigZag Clone – Unity Game Project**

This is a ZigZag-style runner game I created as part of the "Master C# Programming from A to Z" course — specifically in Section 26: UNITY - Building a Zig Zag Clone With Unity.
## __🎮 Game Overview__

This project is a fast-paced runner where the player controls a warrior character navigating a narrow zigzag path. The player can switch the direction between two angles by tapping or clicking, challenging their timing and focus to avoid falling off.

The project was built in Unity 6 (6000.0.25f1) using the Universal Render Pipeline (URP) for improved visuals and performance.
## __🧰 Tools & Packages Used__

    🎮 Unity 6.0 (6000.0.25f1)

    🧱 Universal Render Pipeline (URP)

    🎥 Cinemachine (for smooth camera follow)

    🎮 New Input System (for modern, flexible input handling)

    💻 C# scripting

    ⚙️ Unity Physics and Collider System

    🖼️ Unity UI Toolkit

## __🛠️ Key Features__

    🧍 Warrior character as the player

    🌀 Two-direction movement system

    🧱 Procedural path generation with prefabs

    💥 Fall detection and game over logic

    🎯 Score tracking and simple UI

    🎥 Cinemachine camera system for dynamic movement

    🎮 New Input System for responsive controls

## __💡 What I Learned__

This project helped me:

    Build a complete game using Unity and C#

    Implement character control with the New Input System

    Create smooth camera transitions with Cinemachine

    Use URP for better visual quality

    Work with prefabs, game states, and basic procedural generation

## __🚀 How to Run__

    In Browser:

    Open the project on Itch.io:
