🌀 ZigZag Clone – Unity Game Project

This is a ZigZag-style runner game I created as part of the "Master C# Programming from A to Z" course — specifically in Section 26: UNITY - Building a Zig Zag Clone With Unity.
📚 About the Course

The course covers a wide range of C# and .NET concepts, including:

    C# (Beginner to Advanced)

    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

    Clean Code practices

    .NET Framework

    LINQ, WPF, Generics

    Unit Testing

    Game development with Unity

🎮 Game Overview

This project is a fast-paced runner where the player controls a warrior character navigating a narrow zigzag path. The player can switch the direction between two angles by tapping or clicking, challenging their timing and focus to avoid falling off.

The project was built in Unity 6 (6000.0.25f1) using the Universal Render Pipeline (URP) for improved visuals and performance.

💡 What I Learned

This project helped me:

    Build a complete game using Unity and C#

    Implement character control with the New Input System

    Create smooth camera transitions with Cinemachine

    Use URP for better visual quality

    Work with prefabs, game states, and basic procedural generation
